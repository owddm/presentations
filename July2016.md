# Summer night with cool design and tech.

All are welcome to join our July summer night meetup. 
It is the middle of summer and night is short. But we'll have cool talks and the great company of fellow web designers and developers to compensate.

Our first talk will be on Resilient Design by Jake, we haven't had one of those for a long while and we hope to have more design talks in the future. Follow on from last month's talk on Github/Gitlab, Ben will be talking about Continuous Integration, cool tech tools to automate mundane stuff. Daniel will introduce us to the free and exciting world of OpenStreetMap. We are also having Q&A for those who want to ask our elders on questions about web design or development. Please send us questions and we shall try to answer them at our Q&A session. 

These cool topics are aimed at designers and developers of any level, so feel free to stop by no matter how experienced you are!

To wrap it up, we shall be having a beer at the local Izakaiya for more get-together and in-depth discussion. As always, we'll be taking our themed group picture. Join us on 30 July.
